# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

**Local Development:**
```bash
docker compose up  # Runs application at http://localhost:8080
```

**User Management:**
```bash
docker compose exec web web bin/console app:user:register <email> <password>  # Create user
```

**Code Quality:**
```bash
docker compose exec web composer phpstan          # Run PHPStan static analysis (level max)
docker compose exec web vendor/bin/phpunit       # Run PHPUnit tests
```

**Asset Management:**
```bash
docker compose exec web bin/console importmap:install      # Install frontend assets
docker compose exec web bin/console asset-map:compile     # Compile assets for production
```

## Architecture Overview

This is a **Symfony 7** application for brand manual management, using:

- **CQRS Pattern**: Commands/Queries with dedicated handlers in `Message/` and `MessageHandler/`
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Entities represent core business concepts (Manual, Project, User, etc.)
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Domain events via `EntityWithEvents` trait
- **Dockerized Environment**: Full stack with PostgreSQL, Redis, Minio S3, and MailCatcher

### Core Domain Entities

- **Manual**: Brand manuals with colors, fonts, logos, and mockup pages
- **Project**: Container for brand manuals with sharing capabilities
- **SocialNetworkTemplate**: Templates for social media content with variants
- **EmailSignatureTemplate**: Email signature templates with variants
- **User**: User management with authentication and profiles

### Key Architectural Patterns

- **Message Bus**: All write operations go through Symfony Messenger with dedicated handlers
- **Repository Pattern**: Custom repositories for complex queries (e.g., `ManualRepository`)
- **Value Objects**: Rich domain types in `Value/` directory (Color, Logo, etc.)
- **Security Voters**: Authorization logic in `Services/Security/` 
- **Form Data Objects**: Separate DTOs for form handling in `FormData/`

### External Services

- **S3/Minio**: File storage for uploads and generated assets
- **ImageMagick**: Image processing via PHP Imagick extension
- **Doctrine ORM**: Database layer with migrations and custom types
- **Twig Components**: Live components for interactive UI elements

### Testing Strategy

- PHPUnit with database transactions (`DAMA\DoctrineTestBundle`)
- Controller tests for HTTP endpoints
- Separate test database configuration
- Test fixtures in `tests/DataFixtures/`

### Development Services

- **Adminer**: http://localhost:8000 (postgres/postgres/wboost)
- **MailCatcher**: http://localhost:8025
- **Minio**: http://localhost:19001 (wboost/wboostminio)

Always run any commands in corresponding Docker container - like PHPStan: `docker compose exec web composer run phpstan`

## API (`src/Api/`)

The application exposes a REST API at `/api` powered by API Platform 4. The API is intended for service-to-service communication and is protected by OAuth2 with the `client_credentials` grant.

### Strict DTO rule

**Doctrine entities (`src/Entity/*`) are NEVER exposed as API resources** — neither as request bodies nor as responses. Entities are domain objects; transport shape is decoupled.

Each API feature lives in its own folder under `src/Api/<Feature>/`:

```
src/Api/
└── Projects/
    ├── ProjectResponse.php       ← read DTO carrying #[ApiResource]
    └── ProjectsProvider.php      ← API Platform State Provider (ProviderInterface)
```

A read DTO is a `final readonly class` with public scalar / value-object properties. It carries `#[ApiResource]` plus operation attributes (e.g. `#[GetCollection]`).

A State Provider implements `ApiPlatform\State\ProviderInterface` and is the **only** place that touches the database for that resource — usually via DBAL or a Doctrine repository. It returns one or more DTO instances. It MAY read the authenticated user from `Symfony\Bundle\SecurityBundle\Security` to scope results.

For write operations (none today): use a Request DTO + State Processor (`ApiPlatform\State\ProcessorInterface`) that dispatches a CQRS Message — never mutate entities directly from the processor.

### Adding a new API resource

1. Create `src/Api/<Feature>/<Feature>Response.php` — DTO with `#[ApiResource]`.
2. Create `src/Api/<Feature>/<Feature>Provider.php` — implements `ProviderInterface`.
3. Reference the provider in the operation: `provider: <Feature>Provider::class`.
4. Apply security: `security: "is_granted('IS_AUTHENTICATED_FULLY')"` for service-to-service.
5. Verify the route: `docker compose exec web bin/console debug:router | grep '/api'`.
6. Run `docker compose exec web composer phpstan` and `vendor/bin/phpunit`.

Service-loader convention: only `*Provider.php` and `*Processor.php` files under `src/Api/` are autowired. DTOs are not services.

### OAuth2 (client_credentials)

The API is protected by JWT (RS256) issued via the `client_credentials` grant. Service consumers POST to `/api/token`:

```bash
curl -sX POST https://example.com/api/token \
    -d 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
    -d 'client_id=...' \
    -d 'client_secret=...'
```

The returned bearer token's `sub` claim contains the linked **App User's UUID**. The `api` firewall reads that claim, loads the matching `User` via `api_user_provider`, and the State Provider scopes data to that user.

The link between an OAuth2 client and an App User is a row in `oauth2_client_user` (`client_identifier` → `user_id`), populated by `app:oauth-client:create`.

RSA keys are stored **directly in env vars** as base64-encoded PEM (decoded by Symfony's `%env(base64:...)%` processor); no key files on disk. See `.env` and `.env.local` for the four `OAUTH2_*` variables.

### Managing OAuth2 clients

```bash
# Create a client linked to a user (prints plaintext secret ONCE)
docker compose exec web bin/console app:oauth-client:create user@example.com --name=service-name

# List all clients with their linked users
docker compose exec web bin/console app:oauth-client:list

# Deactivate a client and revoke its outstanding tokens
docker compose exec web bin/console app:oauth-client:revoke <client-id>
```

### API testing

API tests extend `WBoost\Web\Tests\Api\ApiTestCase` (default `Accept: application/ld+json` header). To obtain a real access token in a test, use `WBoost\Web\Tests\TestingApiAuthentication::getAccessToken($client, $clientId, $clientSecret)` — it goes through the live `/api/token` endpoint, which is the contract being exercised. Fixture credentials live as constants on `tests/DataFixtures/TestDataFixture.php` (`OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET`).
